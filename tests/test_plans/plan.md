# A/B Testing Features - Test Plan

## Application Overview

The application includes three different A/B testing related pages that demonstrate various approaches to implementing split testing:
1. Basic A/B Test page
2. Cookie-based A/B Test page
3. Manual (JavaScript-based) A/B Test page

Each page serves different aspects of A/B testing implementation, allowing users to understand and interact with various split testing methodologies.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic A/B Test Page

#### 1.1 Page Load Verification
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the basic A/B test page
2. Verify the page loads successfully

**Expected Results:**
- Page loads without errors
- Page title displays "No A/B Test"
- Informational text about split testing is visible
- Page layout is correctly formatted

#### 1.2 Content Verification
**Steps:**
1. Check the page content
2. Verify the explanation text

**Expected Results:**
- Heading displays "No A/B Test"
- Explanation text about split testing is present and readable
- Text mentions business use cases for A/B testing
- No broken styles or formatting issues

### 2. Cookie-based A/B Test Page

#### 2.1 Initial Page Load
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the A/B Test Cookies page
2. Observe the initial state

**Expected Results:**
- Page loads successfully
- Heading shows "A/B Test Cookies"
- Link to load cookie is visible and clickable
- Explanation text about cookie-based testing is present

#### 2.2 Cookie Implementation Test
**Steps:**
1. Click the "Click here" link
2. Observe page refresh
3. Check cookie presence in browser

**Expected Results:**
- Link click triggers cookie creation
- Page refreshes automatically
- New cookie is present in browser storage
- Page content updates according to cookie value

#### 2.3 Cookie Persistence
**Steps:**
1. Set the test cookie
2. Refresh the page manually
3. Navigate away and return

**Expected Results:**
- Cookie persists through manual refresh
- Cookie maintains value after navigation
- Page consistently shows same variant based on cookie

### 3. Manual (JavaScript) A/B Test Page

#### 3.1 Initial Page State
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to A/B Test Manual page
2. Verify initial page elements

**Expected Results:**
- Page loads successfully
- Heading shows "A/B Test Manual"
- JavaScript activation link is present
- Explanation text about manual testing is visible

#### 3.2 JavaScript Activation
**Steps:**
1. Click the "Click here" link
2. Monitor page behavior
3. Check for JavaScript execution

**Expected Results:**
- Link click executes JavaScript commands
- Page refreshes automatically
- No JavaScript errors in console
- Page variant changes according to JavaScript logic

#### 3.3 JavaScript State Persistence
**Steps:**
1. Activate JavaScript test
2. Refresh page manually
3. Navigate away and return

**Expected Results:**

- JavaScript commands execute without errors
- Page maintains consistent state during session

## Cross-browser Testing Requirements

Test all scenarios in the following browsers:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Mobile Testing Requirements

Verify all scenarios on:
- iOS (latest)
- Android (latest)
- Tablet devices

## Performance Considerations

Monitor and verify:
- Page load times
- Cookie operation speed
- JavaScript execution time
- Network requests efficiency

## Success Criteria

All test scenarios should:
1. Execute without errors
2. Maintain consistent state where applicable
3. Work across all specified browsers
4. Function properly on mobile devices
5. Meet performance benchmarks
6. Provide clear user feedback

## Notes

- All tests should start with a clean browser state (cleared cookies/cache)
- Document any unexpected behavior or edge cases
- Note any browser-specific variations in behavior
- Record performance metrics for optimization

# Dynamic Elements, Authentication, and Image Validation Test Plan

## Application Overview

The application includes three distinct features that test different aspects of web functionality:
1. Add/Remove Elements - Dynamic DOM manipulation
2. Basic Authentication - Security access control
3. Broken Images - Image loading and validation

Each feature tests specific web development concepts and common scenarios encountered in web applications.

## Test Scenarios

3. Verify element removal

**Expected Results:**
- Each clicked button disappears
- Remaining buttons stay in place
- No visual glitches
- Page layout remains stable

### 2. Basic Authentication

#### 2.1 Authentication Success
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the Basic Auth page
2. Enter valid credentials
3. Submit authentication

**Expected Results:**
- Authentication dialog appears
- Valid credentials allow access
- Success message is displayed
- Secure content is visible
- Page loads completely

#### 2.2 Authentication Failure
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the Basic Auth page
2. Enter invalid credentials
3. Submit authentication

**Expected Results:**
- Authentication fails
- Error message is shown
- Access is denied
- User remains on authentication screen

#### 2.3 Authentication Cancellation
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the Basic Auth page
2. Cancel the authentication dialog

**Expected Results:**
- Authentication is cancelled
- Access is denied
- Appropriate message is shown
- User can still navigate away

#### 2.4 Session Persistence
**Steps:**
1. Successfully authenticate
2. Navigate to another page
3. Return to the Basic Auth page

**Expected Results:**
- Session persists appropriately
- No re-authentication required
- Secure content remains accessible

### 3. Broken Images

#### 3.1 Page Load Verification
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the Broken Images page
2. Wait for page load completion

**Expected Results:**
- Page loads without errors
- Page title is correct
- Image containers are visible
- Page layout is proper

#### 3.2 Valid Image Verification
**Steps:**
1. Identify valid images on the page
2. Check image loading status
3. Verify image display

**Expected Results:**
- Valid images load successfully
- Images display correctly
- Image dimensions are correct
- Alt text is present if specified

#### 3.3 Broken Image Detection
**Steps:**
1. Identify broken images
2. Check broken image indicators
3. Verify error handling

**Expected Results:**
- Broken images are properly identified
- Broken image placeholders shown
- Error handling is graceful
- Alt text or fallback content displays

#### 3.4 Image Loading Performance
**Steps:**
1. Load the page multiple times
2. Monitor image loading behavior
3. Check loading indicators

**Expected Results:**
- Images load efficiently
- Loading indicators display properly
- Page remains responsive
- No layout shifts during loading

## Cross-browser Testing Requirements

Test all scenarios in:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Mobile Testing Requirements

Verify all scenarios on:
- iOS (latest) - Safari
- Android (latest) - Chrome
- Various screen sizes
- Different pixel densities

## Performance Considerations

Monitor and verify:
- Element addition/removal speed
- Authentication response time
- Image loading performance
- Memory usage with many elements
- Network efficiency

## Success Criteria

All test scenarios should:
1. Execute without errors
2. Maintain consistent behavior
3. Work across all specified browsers
4. Function properly on mobile devices
5. Meet performance benchmarks
6. Handle edge cases gracefully
7. Provide clear user feedback

## Notes

- Test with various network conditions
- Verify memory management with large numbers of elements
- Test image loading with different cache states
- Document any browser-specific authentication behaviors
- Monitor console for errors during all operations
- Test with different image sizes and formats
